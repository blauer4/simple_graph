An easy way to see your average score on the DoExercise platform

This site has been made with a little php script I wrote that fetches information about your exercises from the
original [site]("http://datascience.maths.unitn.it/ocpu/library/doexercises/www/")

It uses Bootstrap 4.4.1, with some customization made with Sass. The data is in display
with the help of the Chart.js script. 

If something doesn't work, probably they changed something with the original site, and how it handles requests.
